## About Me

I am an Associate Professor at South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China. I received my Ph.D. in Power Electronics from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2018 and was a Postdoctoral Fellow the UM Macao Talent Program with the State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, University of Macau, in 2019. Over the past 15 years, I have dedicated to the field of Power Electronics and its interdisciplinary applications and am listed among the **Top 2% of Scientists Worldwide by Stanford University**. My current research focuses on
* Wireless Power Transfer
* Resonant Power Conversion
* Large-Scale Renewable Power Generation
* Artificial Intelligence for Power Electronics
* Wave Energy Converters. 
<!-- Over the past five years, he has served as Principal Investigator for 16 research projects (including several interdisciplinary initiatives), securing a total funding of over 1,023,000 USD.  -->

I am serving as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics and was a Guest Editor for IEEE Open Journal of Circuits and Systems. I am also an active peer reviewer for various top IEEE journals and has been recognized with 5 reviewer awards from IEEE journals.
